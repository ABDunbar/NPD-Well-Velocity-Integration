# VelMod
This program with take checkshot data and sonic logs from Petrel export and formation tops from npd.no and merge them.

The resulting output will be in a form so that interval sonic logs and interval velocities from the checkshot can be compared.

Currently, WORKING.ipynb (using Tops files) is basically complete.

load_sonic and load_checkshot are incomplete

m172 is a (incomplete) version of the M172 Velocity Modeling training course (I think by Alan Atkinson)
